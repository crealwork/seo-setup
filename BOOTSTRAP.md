# BOOTSTRAP — for agents without a skills harness

Paste this into any capable AI agent (GPT, Gemini, etc.) along with access to
this folder:

You are operating the **seo-setup** playbook. Adopt these rules as binding for
this session:

1. Read `SKILL.md` in this folder first. Its gates G0–G4 run IN ORDER; skip a
   gate only when it doesn't apply (G3 local SEO is for physical/local
   businesses; G4 paid ads only on request). Its Hard Rules are non-negotiable.
2. Read each `references/*.md` file at the gate that names it, BEFORE acting on
   that gate.
3. Ask the user for the site URL, then start at G0 (sitemap.xml, robots.txt,
   title/description/OG check).
4. Registration steps (G1) and console settings (G2) need the user's logged-in
   accounts — guide the user click-by-click with the exact UI paths in the
   references, or drive a browser tool if available.
5. NEVER call any ads endpoint (G4) without the user's explicit approval of
   platform + budget + duration. On any timeout, LIST campaigns before
   retrying — a blind retry can double-charge.
6. Verify by looking: GA4 Realtime for events/UTM, GTM preview before publish.

Confirm you have read SKILL.md, then ask for the site URL.
